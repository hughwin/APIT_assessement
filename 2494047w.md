As a brief summary, the Twenty-One application is designed so that all of the gameLogic and manipulation of the model is handled on the server. The client simply acts as a view and a controller for the user. Changes in game state caused by player actions are then broadcast to the other connected clients. 

When the user runs the client, they are not connected until they click on "Play game". This was designed intentionally, as it seemed pointless to join the server (and have to be handled) until the user was actually ready to play the game. It also allows the user the opportunity to enter a meaningful name to display to other users. 


Once the user decides they want to play, and click on the "Play game" button, the `startGame()` method is called from within `Client`. The `startGame()` method creates a new `Socket` to allow communication with the server, and immediately writes a new `Player` object to its output stream.  The `startGame` method also manipulates the view to show the user the `GamePage`, and creates a `ReadWorker` object (which implements `SwingWorker`) from a private inner class within `ReadWorker` and calls `execute()` on the newly created `ReadWorker` object, starting the worker Thread implemented in `doInBackground()`. 

The worker Thread updates the view on a seperate thread from the event dispatch thread. The worker thread listens to the input stream of the socket for objects. Once an object is recieved from the server, the `Client`'s private representation of `GameState` (`gameState`) is updated, and the accordingly the view. 

The `Server` is built to implement the `Runnable` interface. Once, the `Server` object is created, its `run()` method is called on a new `Thread` with `start()`. In the `run()` method, the is thread is held in a infinite loop waiting for incoming connections with the `.accept()` method. Once a new connection arrives, the server creates a new client, adds this client to a private vector named `clients` containing all the current active clients. 

The `Player` object written to the object output stream is handled by the client. This player is assigned a unique `id` from the `ID` variable of the `ClientRunner`, which `ClientRunner` was given when it was created by `Server`. The `Player` object is then added to the `concurrentHashMap activePlayers` in the `GameState` class with the key of the `Player` object set to the `id` variable the in the `Player` object. The `ID` is then sent back to the client via the `updateLocalSession()` method in the `Client` object, read by the object input stream and assigned to the `sessionID` variable. This ensures that the instance of `Client`, the `Player` object, and the key for the HashMap all correspond to one another.  

When the `Server` class is created it creates the private object `GameController`. Once the clients are connected the `Server` class' role is to listen to incoming requests from the clients and handle them. To do this efficiently, it uses `GameController` to manipulate the model of the game before transmitting these changes back to the clients through the `Server` class' `sendGameState()` method sends `GameController's` private object `GameState` to the clients. 

The `GameState` object is the representation of the game. This class' function is to act as a containing class for all the objects that make up the game such as the `Dealer`, `Cards`, `Deck`, and the `concurrentHashMap ActivePlayers` (containing `Player` objects currently playing the game). If there is a change in the state of the game, the `GameState` object is returned to the connected clients, ensuring that the state of the game on the server is consistent with the state of the game on the connected clients. 

When the clients first connect to the server, the `Player` objects in `activePlayers` (a vector) have an instance boolean variable called `ready`. The purpose of this variable is to control the start of the game. 

There are two important methods that control the flow of the game: `checkPlayersReady()` in the `GameController` class, `playRound()` in the `GameLoop` class. Both these methods implement the `Runnable` interface.

The `run()` method inside `GameController` is designed to iterate over the vector containing the connected clients and assess whether each of the connected `Player` objects have had their `ready` variable set to true. It does this in an infinite loop, and the thread that in runs on is never cancelled. If any of the connected `Player` objects have `ready` set to false, the `checkPlayersReady()` method returns false. Once all the `Player` objects inside `activePlayers` have had their `ready` variable set to true, the `checkPlayersReady()` returns true to complete and call the `startGame()` method inside `GameController`. 

The advantage of having the `run()` method in `GameController` is that new `Player` objects that are added to the `activePlayers` aren't included in the current round, and do not disrupt the flow of play. 

The `startGame()` method modifies a number of variables in `GameState` for the purposes of the view. The `startGame()` method then creates a new `GameLoop` object and a new `Thread` and calls `start()` on the newly created `Thread` object. 

The `GameLoop` controls the playing of a round. The connected clients at the start of a round are added into another vector within `GameLoop` called `playersInRound` which represents the current players in that round only. This allows for other clients to join whilst the game is in progress and avoids aberrant behaviour such as the flow of the game being interrupted, or a player not being given any cards. The `run()` method in loops endlessly detecting the currently active `Player` object and the state of that objects hand (whether they have gone bust, got 21, or decided to stand).

The state of a `Player` is controlled by a number of boolean values. For example, if the player is standing, the `standing` variable in `Player` is set to `true`. 

Once all players have had their turns, the while loop ensuring all players have played is broken out of. Each `Player` object is then evaluated in a loop and the results of the round are computed against the dealer's score to determine the winning and losing players. The `endRound()` method is then called in `GameController`. The `endRound()` method modifies the state of the game to let the clients know that a round has been concluded.  

The game continues until a player quits of their own volition, or has a `balance` of `0` at the end of a round, at which point they are removed from the game. 

The `GameLoop` class could have been simplified significantly (only updating the clients when the player whose turn it was played their hand), however, it was designed to be as dynamic and responsive to changes in the gamestate as possible, for instance, continuing when the player whose turn it is quits unexpectedly.
